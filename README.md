# github-api interogation using R to do text analysis on commit comments.

I made use of several lexicons namely Bing which I used to give batched comments aggregated sentiment scores. Positive words (e.g. nice, great etc) we're given positive scores from +1 to +5 and negative words were rated from -1 to -5. Look at the graphs to see what the scripts produced. Also, clear all environment variables when switching between rails and linux.
